                    <h3>A New Way to Organize Your Car Parts Inventory</h3>
                    <img src="img/work.jpg" alt="guy talking on phone" float: "left"; width="500" height="400" />
                    <p>I have designed a system for organizing car parts in autoshops. Nowadays, many management systems used
                        today are very outdated.This will remedy that problem. As a business owner, you want to make your
                        work as easy and efficient as possible. As a customer, you want to make your experience at an autoshop
                        as convienient as possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="tab-2">
                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <img src="http://acctivate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auto-parts-for-distribution-500x333.jpg" alt="wrenches and car parts"
                    />
                    <p>This system works by letting you see what parts are in stock for what cars, who made the part or who
                        supplied the part to your shop. This will help you easily find parts that you customers need. It
                        will also help you to organize your inventory and keep stock of your supplies.The system is the completely
                        redesigned, modern and intuitive interface for our Find and Sell process. It was designed with speed
                        in mind. Confirm in a glance that your customer is in good standing, thanks to the "thumbs up" icon
                        on the search screen. Find and sell an unlimited number of parts at one time. See part images alongside
                        your search results. Navigate through your workflow with your mouse or with your keyboard - however
                        you feel comfortable.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq">Why You Should Use It</h3>
                    <p>One of the reasons this system will be useful to you is because it is organized. As everyone knows, organization
                        is essential for any successful business. At some point, traditional methods aren't going to cut
                        it. We are in a technological age and businesses will find technology essential. Customers also expect
                        it. Since technology makes everything much more convienient for consumers, your customers are going
                        to expect this.

                    <h4>Will this work on older computers?</h4>
